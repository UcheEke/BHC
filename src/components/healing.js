            <p>Barnes Healing Church has been a Healing Church since 1966 – for over 40 years. The very fabric of the building radiates a loving healing energy, in the midst of London’s busy and hectic lifestyle. We are known both locally and globally and visitors return time and time again, not only because of the benefits they feel they receive, but also because we endeavour to make everyone as welcome as possible.</p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>Healing is available on Tuesday evenings from 7pm until 8:00pm, and Thursday lunchtime from 10:30am until 1:30pm. There is no charge for healing but there is a suggested donation of £5 for Thursday one-to-one Healing as the church is run solely on donations and goodwill.</p>

            <h4>What is Healing?</h4>
            <p>All living beings have an inate ability to achieve a perfect state of equilibrium in body, mind and spirit. The purpose of healing is to enhance and empower the individual and assist him or her to find their own point of balance. The healer/s are the channel for natural healing energies to help bring this about.</p>
            <p>Healing may be given for any illness, stress or injury as a complementary therapy without any side effects. No specific religious or spiritual beliefs are required. Similarly, healing recognises no distinction of race, class, gender, sexual orientation or religion.</p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>Healing is not a magic wand that can make all well. It is a process that involves your commitment and although the healer/s seek to work with you, healing cannot be imposed in any way. A willingness to change is the fundamental requirement in the healing process. No guarantee can or will be made about the outcome of healing. A strict code of confidentiality applies to all healing situations.</p>
            </blockquote>


            <h4>Thursday 10.30am – 1.30pm Healing Sessions</h4>

            <p>As a complimentary alternative to the Tuesday Healing, the Thursday Healing offers Individual or group healing.  During individual healing you may receive healing by either sitting on a chair or lying on a couch and the healing is given by one healer. This form of healing is particularly good if you have not experienced healing before or if you prefer a one-to-one situation. Contact (hands on) or energy (hands off) healing are appropriate for individual healing. Individual healing sessions take up to half an hour.</p>
            <p>Alternatively, in group healing you lie on a couch and three healers work in unison with you in the contact (hands on) method. This gives the benefit of three healer energy flows which takes less time (i.e. 15 minutes), but is never-the-less highly efficient. Although it is not always possible to see the same healer or group of healers at subsequent sessions, the healing energy is equally powerful and beneficial to all. The availability of group healing will depend on the number of healers present on any particular day.</p>
